# Bouquet Assembly Interface — Proposal Version

This patch implements the interaction described in the **Technical Prompt for Figma AI**:

- Light pink full-width background
- 5 draggable flower components starting around the canvas
- Center bouquet silhouette with five target drop zones (puzzle-like)
- Correct-type-only placement (each flower must be placed in its matching zone)
- Full-screen overlay on completion with the message **WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME** and confetti rain

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000
